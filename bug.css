The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red; /* This rule will be overridden */
}

.container div.special {
  color: green; /* This rule should override the previous one */
}

.container div.special {
  color: purple; /* This rule should not override the previous one */
}

.special.container div {
  color: yellow; /* This rule will override both previous ones */
}
```

The issue lies in the unexpected behavior when multiple selectors target the same element with equal or similar specificity.  In this case, the fourth rule `.container div.special { color: purple; }` does not override the third rule because they have the same specificity. The last rule however does override because of higher specificity.
